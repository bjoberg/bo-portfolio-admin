# Brett Oberg

Heyyooo 👋🏼, thanks for taking the time to visit my photography portfolio. My name is Brett Oberg, and in my spare time I take photos. I am inspired by nature and I use photography as an excuse to experience its beauty. Photography has helped give direction and purpose to my life, and I hope my images inspire you to go out and find what is special for you.

Aside from photography, I spend my time developing software (like this website 😜), cycling, golfing, playing tennis, and spening time with family.

I hope you enjoy my work and would like to collaborate on a project or chat over coffee ☕️, please email me at [brett.oberg8@gmail.com](mailto:brett.oberg8@gmail.com).
